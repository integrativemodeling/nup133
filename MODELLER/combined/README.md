This directory contains MODELLER inputs to generate the starting
comparative model of the entire Nup133 in one pass from all templates.
This is a convenience to provide a list of all the templates used and their
alignments. The real procedure employed was stepwise, first generating models of
smaller subconstructs, filtering them against SAXS data, and then using these
models to inform models of larger parts of the structure.
